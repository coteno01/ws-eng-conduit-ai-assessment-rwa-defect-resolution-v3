## Problem 1

**Problem**: The tags are broken up into individual characters on the post view page.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

**Answer**: *Please fill this in*
The underlying issue causing the tags to be broken up into individual characters on the post view page is that the `tagList` is being treated as a single string instead of an array of strings. This issue likely originates from how the `tagList` is handled in the Angular component and how it is sent to the backend.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the problem and its origin:

### Problem Analysis

When the `tagList` input is submitted as a single string (e.g., "man woman child"), it should be split into an array of strings (e.g., `['man', 'woman', 'child']`) before being sent to the backend or stored in the database.

If this splitting is not done correctly, the `tagList` will be treated as a single string, and when it is rendered on the post view page, it will appear as individual characters.

### Origin of the Issue

The issue originates from the Angular component where the `tagList` is handled. Specifically, it stems from the `ArticleEditComponent` and possibly the form handling logic that does not correctly parse the `tagList` before submitting it.

### Steps to Identify and Fix the Issue

1. **Check the Angular Component (ArticleEditComponent)**:
   Ensure that the `tagList` input is correctly parsed into an array of strings before submitting the form.

2. **Check the DTO and Backend Handling**:
   Ensure that the backend expects and correctly processes the `tagList` as an array of strings.

### Detailed Solution

#### 1. Update the Angular Component

Ensure that the `tagList` is split into an array of strings before submitting the form. Modify the `submit` method in `ArticleEditComponent` to handle this:

#### 2. Ensure Backend DTO and Service Handle Array

Ensure that the backend DTO and service handle the `tagList` as an array of strings.

### Summary

The issue of tags being broken up into individual characters originates from the Angular component (`ArticleEditComponent`) where the `tagList` is not correctly parsed into an array of strings before submitting the form. By ensuring that the `tagList` is split into an array of strings in the `submit` method, and verifying that the backend correctly handles this array, you can resolve this issue.

## Problem 2

**Problem**: New tags  are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags", even after a page refresh.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

**Answer**: *Please fill this in*

The issue where new tags are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags" even after a page refresh can be caused by several factors. Let's break down the potential causes and identify the component or file in the project where the issue might originate.

### Potential Causes

1. **Tags Not Persisted in the Database**: The tags might not be saved correctly in the database when a new article is created or updated.
2. **Tags Not Fetched Correctly**: The home page might not be fetching the latest tags from the backend.
3. **Backend Endpoint Issue**: The backend endpoint responsible for fetching popular tags might not be working correctly.
4. **Caching Issues**: There could be a caching issue where the tags are not updated in the frontend.

### Step-by-Step Diagnosis

#### 1. Verify Tag Persistence in the Database

Ensure that the tags are being correctly saved in the database when a new article is created or updated.


#### 2. Verify Backend Endpoint for Fetching Tags

Ensure that the backend endpoint responsible for fetching popular tags is working correctly. This endpoint should aggregate tags and return a list of popular tags.


#### 4. Verify Caching and State Management

Ensure that there are no caching issues and that the state management (e.g., NgRx) is correctly handling the tags.

### Conclusion

The underlying issue likely originates from one of the following components:

1. **ArticleService (NestJS Backend)**: Ensure tags are correctly persisted when creating or updating articles.
2. **TagService (NestJS Backend)**: Ensure the service correctly fetches tags from the database.
3. **TagController (NestJS Backend)**: Ensure the controller correctly exposes the endpoint for fetching tags.
4. **TagService (Angular Frontend)**: Ensure the frontend service correctly fetches and processes tags from the backend.
5. **HomeComponent (Angular Frontend)**: Ensure the component correctly fetches and displays tags.

By ensuring that each of these components is correctly implemented and integrated, you can resolve the issue of new tags not being shown on the home page under "Popular Tags".
